TODO
- Lots of functionality is missing
  - Persistence and sessions
  - File selection
  - Switch image within a XILWindow
- Zoom for XILWindow should be factored out as a transform?
  - Similarly, move could/should be stored as a transform
- Consider reordering transforms in a workflow
  - Maybe switch to float coordinates instead of integer
- Move XILWindows from one XWindow to another (it can't just be moved with the mouse)
- ImageFile should check whether the file exists when it's created

BUGS
- If zooming a window with an active crop, the crop does not change its size
