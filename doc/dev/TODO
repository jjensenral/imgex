TODO
- Lots of functionality is missing
  - Persistence and sessions
  - File selection
  - Switch image within a XILWindow
- Zoom for XILWindow should be factored out as a transform
- Move XILWindows from one XWindow to another (it can't just be moved with the mouse)

BUGS
- If zooming a window with an active crop, the crop does not change its size
