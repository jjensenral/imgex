TODO
- Lots of functionality is missing
  - Persistence and sessions
  - File selection
  - Switch image within a XILWindow (as alternative to file selector)?
  - Raise/lower image inside XWindow
  - Choosing when to persist image manipulations
- Maybe switch to float coordinates (QRectF) instead of integer (QRect)
- Move XILWindows from one XWindow to another (it can't just be moved with the mouse)
  - Can we do it seamlessly so the image overlaps both XWindows during the transition?
- ImageFile should check whether the file exists when it's created
- Some of the event handled logic needs tidying up?
- Compile and test with Qt6
- Support for opening/closing an individual XWindow

BUGS
- If zooming a window with an active crop, the crop does not change its size

DONE (OR NO LONGER NEEDED)
- Zoom for XILWindow should be factored out as a transform?
  - Similarly, move could/should be stored as a transform
- Consider reordering transforms in a transform
  - Swapping transforms can alter them (eg swapping zoom and crop)
  - Multiple move transforms can be merged into one (in principle)
